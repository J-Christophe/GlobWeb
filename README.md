GlobWeb
=======

Virtual Globe with WebGL

GlobWeb is a Javascript library developed by Telespazio France using the new WebGL standard. WebGL allows embedding 3D visualisation in a browser without any plugin and is supported on recent versions of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.
The main focus of GlobWeb is to provide a high performance 3D library for visualizing geospatial data, Telespazio being itself a provider of geospatial data through its partner GeoEye.
Through a partnership with CNES and CDS, GlobWeb also supports visualization of astronomical data.  
GlobWeb supports the following features:
 * Base raster layer using WMS, Bing Map REST API, WorldWind Tile Service, HEALPix
 * Manipulation of vector data through GeoJSON interface: add/remove/select/style modification
 * Overlay WMS layer on top of existing base layers
 * High performance vector rendering  : automatic tiling of vector data
